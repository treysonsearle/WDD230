         <h1>Target Audience</h1>
         <p>
            There are serval different people that would come to a weather page.
            Weather affects so many things suchs as appeitate, traffic, and traveling.
            The first persona I would like to have is the Police. In Arizona weather affects
            their work a lot. Rain usually means more accidents so them knowing where rain will be
            they can have more officers on duty to respond to them. Heat warnings mean more people
            with heat exhaustion. The police can respond and look out for homeless people that my not
            be getting the care they need. Next is local business. At the end of the summer a highway
            in Arizona closed down which had never closed before had and some businesses were unable to
            provide the products customers were wanting. Looking into future weather predictions can
            allow for business owner to have the supply before hand. Next some businesses thrive on weather.
            If it is sunny pools can be open and have the work force scheduled a head of time. If it is rainning some
            businesses might need to change their menus to fit for a rainy day appetite.
